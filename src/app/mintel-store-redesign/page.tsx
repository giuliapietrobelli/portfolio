        My responsibilities consisted of improving the general look and feel of the existing website running in
        WordPress and give it a more modern look. The challenge was also to improve the UX of some pages to offer a
        better experience for the customers in order to help them easily find the reports they need. I was responsible
        for the communication with the developer and worked closely with the IT team.

            <li><b>Research and Analysis:</b> Based my design strategy on an in-depth user analysis conducted by an external company.
              This analysis tracked and examined user journeys to identify design weaknesses and areas for improvement.</li>
            <li><b>Website Redesign:</b> Improved the overall look and feel of the existing WordPress website, giving it a modern and visually appealing update while accounting for the platform&apos;s technical limitations in terms of functionality and design..</li>
            <li><b>User Experience Enhancement:</b> Enhanced the UX of key pages to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience, making it easier for customers to find and purchase the reports they need.</li>

        <ProjectIntro subtitle="Challenges and Solutions">
        A major challenge was updating the design while maintaining brand consistency and integrating with older designs and newer elements created by different teams.
        By adhering to a unified design language, I ensured a seamless visual and functional transition across the website.
